No, try again by giving control to the user and recording the user's actions. 
No, use '/documentation.mhtml' instead.
No, revise your plan by not using clone_repository command.

You are on a Windows machine, revise your plans and actions according to it. Make sure you store this information on both long and short term memories.

Use another approach.

I have placed neccessary folder at "C:\Users\umutcan\Documents\AI\AutoGPT_master\auto_gpt_workspace\genieai.chatgpt-vscode-0.0.8" use this folder instead.

That file does not exist. Create it on current directory.
That file does not exist, create a new one.

The correct directory is "C:\Users\umutcan\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code" revise your plans and actions according to it.

I've downloaded the neccessary files and placed them at "/" for your convenience. Use them.
